# AllMine, a flexible pipeline for Allele Mining
### What is AllMine ?
AllMine is flexible and parallel pipeline for allele mining. You can use AllMine to discover *de novo* Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (**SNPs**) onto next generation sequencing data of various types (RNAseq, WGS, RRGS *ect.*). AllMine working principle is to compare your sequencing data to a annotated reference sequence to call SNPs. By defining target regions onto your reference sequence, your can extract specific SNPs and discover allele polymorphism.
