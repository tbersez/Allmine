AllMine Documentation
*********************

AllMine is a flexible allele mining pipeline. AllMine can handle various NGS
data types (WGS, RRGS, RNAseq, paired/sengle end layouts...) and process all
steps from raw reads to de novo SNPs phasing and annotation. Designed for easy
usage, AllMine can be use by non bioinformaticians. AllMine is HPC compatible
via Slurm.

AllMine was developed at INRA's PACA GAFL unit. For more informations on our
lab, please visit our `web page <https://www6.paca.inra.fr/gafl/>`_.
